# Mid Module Project

This project is developed as part of the Mid Module assessment for the course CSCK541 - Software Development.

## Description

The project implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph. It provides both recursive and imperative implementations of the algorithm.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- `floyd_recursive.py`: Python script implementing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm using recursion.
- `floyd_imperative.py`: Python script implementing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm using an imperative approach.
- `test_floyd_recursive.py`: Unit tests for the recursive implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
- `test_floyd_imperative.py`: Unit tests for the imperative implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
- `performance_test_floyd_recursive.py`: Performance test for the recursive implementation.
- `performance_test_floyd_imperative.py`: Performance test for the imperative implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: File containing a list of Python dependencies for the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

To run the unit tests, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python -m unittest

To run the performance tests, execute the following command in the terminal:

python performance_test_floyd_recursive.py
python performance_test_floyd_imperative.py

Requirements
The project requires Python 3.x. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
